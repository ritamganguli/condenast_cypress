You, the reader, can submit a caption for that week’s contest; help us find the best (and root out the worst) by rating the funniness of captions from the previous week’s contest; or help select the winning caption by voting on three finalists from the week prior.</br> </br>Feel free to dive in and get voting, even if you haven’t submitted a caption. Many strive to etch their names into the hall of fame of cartoon captioning. Do you have what it takes?</br></br>Please refer to the complete rules for additional details."
